#5. Write a class vector representing a vector of n dimensions. Overload the + and * operator which calculates the sum and the dot(.) product of them.

#6. Write_str_() method to print the vector as follows:

# 71 +81 +10k

#Assume vector of dimension 3 for this problem.

#7. Override the _len_() method on vector of problem 5 to display the dimension of the vector.
